# Predicting Song Popularity

Through linear regression modeling, this project aims to predict the popularity of a song. 

The final dataset used in this project was a compilation of a 2,000 song Spotify dataset sourced from Kaggle along with additional data gathered from API requests to Spotify's API.  

The target variable assessed was a popularity score for each song. The explantory variables covered a range of characteristics on each song, from specific audio features like BPM,valence,and duration to more categorical data such as, genre, year released and artist follower count.
