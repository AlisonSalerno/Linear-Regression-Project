# Predicting Song Popularity

Through linear regression modeling, this project aims to predict the popularity of a song. 

The final dataset used in this project was a compilation of a 2,000 song Spotify dataset sourced from Kaggle and additional data gathered from API requests to Spotify's API. The final dataset contained characteristics of each song -  from audio features to categorical data to a popularity score. Using popularity score as my target, I set out to create my model.
